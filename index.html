          <p>
            From programming applications for personal use to playing music for friends 
            and my local college community, I utilize my skills and knowledge to enhance 
            my way of living. Though I have strong confidence in my skills and execution 
            of my plans, there are still certain aspects of my abilities that I feel the 
            need to work on. Despite knowing my faults, I strive to grow and learn new 
            concepts and ideas that will better my current capabilities. To highlight 
            my strengths, please continue exploring my portfolio and form your own 
            impression of me.

            These are programmed-based projects that, for the most part, are primarily 
            made for personal amusement and curiosity. Two are group projects, one utilizing 
            Arduino and the other being Full-Stack based. The rest show my knowledge with 
            Python, but I do have intermediate experience with C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
            and a bit of Assembly.

                This project was to show a possible website that can help users who aren’t familiar with programming 
                in HTML or any other coding language be exposed to it with this language-teaching application called 
                CodeBytes. Taking each step bit-by-bit! The project is currently not on going, but it was my first 
                exposure to HTML and CSS, with most of my part of the project going into the UI/UX implementation 
                (from design to code).

                Kamay Guys is the name of the group that I was with when creating 
                this rover that grabs blocks. The control of the rover was through 
                bluetooth that is finger-based. The glove-controller has flexible 
                resistors (flex-sensors) that provides bytes to the master and 
                slave bluetooth modules that dictate the movement of the rover. 
                My part of the project was implementing the flex-sensor 
                implementation (from user-input to value).

          <p>
            Since Feburary 2025, my band and I have existed 
            and played music for friends, student clubs, and 
            student-ran events nearby UCI. We're a cover band 
            (for now) and we try to learn any songs people 
            reccommend to us. The genre that we primarily 
            play is pop music, and we try our best to make our 
            cover sound as close as it can with the current 
            instrument that we have. With that being said 
            here's the wonderful individuals that make up
            The Mix!

                Utilizing her vocal skills from practicing between her acapella group and free time, Hazel sings in her 
                own unique way that once you hear her voice you will know that it's her singing. Getting her inspiration 
                from Michael Jackson and many other artists of the like, she pushes herself to sound great for any performance 
                and occasion. Her drive to sound perfect is indescribable, but you'll hear her effort, experience, and technique 
                in her singing.

              <p>
                Having a musically inclined father, Derick has been exposed to music at a very young age, playing a variety of 
                instruments. From the flute, to the guitar, to the easy percussion instruments anyone can play, Derick is multilingual 
                between multiple instruments and if he really wanted to he could make a solo, indie album. Not only is he gifted in music, 
                but he’s amenable with film and art. Having a major in film and utilizing his art skills to help him with that major 
                (drawing out scenes, expressing how characters should feel, etc…) he utilizes all of his skills as much as he can. You could 
                say he’s a jack of all trades.

              <p>
                Ever since high school, Bianca has been playing the bass with multiple different bands with widely different genres. 
                From punk, to pop, all the way back to latin rock, Bianca can play the bass to any genre she’s exposed to. Outside of 
                music, she does charitable acts for the need, volunteering at food shelters and providing it when possible. With 
                everything that she does, she is truly a one of a kind person that has more special skills than most.

            <div class = 'member-bio-right'>
              <p>
                For awhile, Marcos has been playing the piano and has fundamentally understood the instrument so well that he can 
                basically transfer his music skills to a new instrument and get to an intermediate level with the instrument in days. 
                His improv, on the spot thinking has always filled the emptiness of our band, making it always feel whole when we play. 
                Besides his skills in intuition and being able to pick up new skills on the fly, he’s also an aerospace engineer, highlighting 
                (on occasion) how physics dictate sound, relating it back to music. Marcos is adds feeling to the music we play, so I’m 
                thankful to have a person like him to be playing with me.

              <p>
                There's no self-righteous way to coat this. I’ve played many songs with this band, and pop music is notoriously known to have 
                very easy drum rudiments. In comparison to others within the band, my job is to keep the tempo (non-existent with the way we 
                play) and have everyone be on the same page (works most of the time). Overall, the effort that I need to insert into a song 
                is not as much as everybody else since I don’t need to worry about notes, just the rhythm and rests throughout the song. 
                Overall, I enjoy being the drummer since I’m able to play any song on a whim.
